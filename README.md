# ðŸ‘‹ Hi,
Iâ€™m @NeutrinoResonance


- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in FHE, ZKP, the theoretical and implementation underpinnings of bleeding edge cryptography in general
  - Currently studying ZKP, ZKML, FHE, FHEML, in general
  - ... presently, anti-tamper mechanisms for FHE circuits, deployment of FHE on Solana, and Ethereum block chains
- At a consistently ranked-number-one science-oriented university, I studied Computer Science, with specific emphasis on program analysis and systems engineering. I wrote low-level code to investigate implementation of full RAM encryption on x86 processors, co-developed concolic executor back ends and specialized constraint languages to auto-prioritize bugs based on their provable security risk. A hard won Bachelors and Masters of Engineering followed.
- My non-university professional experience spans malware analysis, in depth binary analysis, reverse engineering, and pentest tool development. Regarding software engineering: large scale systems engineering (web crawlers, data pipelines on both Google Compute Platform and Amazon Web Services), machine learning (including LLMs and surrounding applications), as well as web back-end and front end using React/NextJS/Vue.

# Crypto-Relevant Expertise
- Proof-related: Circom, Z3, some CoQ, heavy amount of logic and math inside the university, wrote internal paper regarding difficulty of obfuscation of integer overflow patch checks using point obfuscation
- FHE-related: Microsoft SEAL, OpenFHE, built lots of boolean ciruits to make a MIPS-esque (with paging / virtual memory!) simulated processor, worked with SciPy, Mathematica, and other packages to get polynomial approximations of different functions

# Security-Relevant Experience
- In depth Windows reverse engineering and exploitation experience. Created `IIS_MachineKey`, a potent attack toolchain for large-scale Microsoft IIS installations, [for the Immunity Canvas exploit framework](https://vimeo.com/260982761)

Currently looking for interesting work!
